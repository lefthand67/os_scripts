# make the script executable by user (groups and other users are disabled in this command)
chmod 700 your_script.sh


# start a script

Source Script: Ensure that you are running the script using the `source` command or the `.` (dot) command to execute it in the current shell session. If you just run the script directly (`./your_script.sh`), it will be executed in a subshell, and any changes made (like activating the virtual environment) will only affect that subshell.

Use:

source your_script.sh
# or
. your_script.sh
# or
bash your_script.sh

If you are not in the home directory, use:
. ~/your_script.sh
